# 👋 Hi, I'm Russel  

I’m an **Automation Specialist** passionate about connecting CRMs, APIs, and AI tools to create efficient, scalable systems.  

💡 *“If it saves time or makes data flow smoother — I’ll automate it.”*

## 🚀 What I Do

I build **AI-powered automations** that connect tools, CRMs, and APIs — simplifying complex workflows and enabling scalable systems for businesses.

### ⚙️ Platforms & Integrations
- ⚙️ Automations with **n8n**, **GoHighLevel**, and **VideoAsk**  
- 🤖 AI integrations using **OpenAI**, **Claude**, **Vapi**, and **Retell**  
- 🧩 Google **Apps Script** & custom-built dashboards  
- 🗂️ CRM and marketplace integrations with **Salesforce**, **LeadPerfection**, **ActiveProspect**, and **Google Workspace**  
- 🔗 Custom API connectors and webhook logic for multi-platform syncs  

I rely on **API documentation** as my main source when building integrations —  
AI helps me code faster, but I always **learn, adapt, and build from the docs first**.  
> “If I know it, I do it. If I don’t, I learn it — then build it.”
